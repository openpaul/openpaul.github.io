This space serves as a collection of analyses I've reproduced from research papers or the wider field of computational biology. 

Each blog posts is me learning, as such if you find mistakes or inaccuracies, I would be happy to discuss with you. The easiest way would be to open an [issue](https://github.com/openpaul/openpaul.github.io/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/openpaul/openpaul.github.io/pulls). 

When reproducing a paper I will try to use the same or similar tools as the original authors. 
This way I aim to deepen my understanding of their conclusions and the challenges they faced with the data. 

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something interesting here. Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of computational biology.
