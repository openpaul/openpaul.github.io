Hello! I'm a computational biologist with a passion for biology and nature. My interests lie at the intersection of genomics and data science, and I'm excited to share some of my smaller projects here.

## About This Repository

This space serves as a collection of analyses I've reproduced from research papers. 
By using the same or similar tools as the original authors, I aim to deepen my understanding of their conclusions and the challenges they faced with the data. 

## A Note on Datasets

I recognize that I won't always have the time to explore each dataset thoroughly, especially regarding quality and completeness. Therefore, I will assume that the datasets contain what the authors describe and can be used as is. In a real-world scenario, I would delve deeper, examine more parameters, and compare multiple tools.

## Get Involved!

If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, feel free to open an issue, submit a pull request, or reach out to me directly. I'm always looking to learn something new and love to collaborate!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something interesting here. Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of computational biology.
