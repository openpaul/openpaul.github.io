# Welcome

I am a computational biologist with interest in biology and nature. 
I am facinated by genomics and data science and am using this [GitHub pages](https://openpaul.github.io/) to
finally share some of my smaller projects. 

If you have questions or issues, do open a issue or a PR or contact me directly.
