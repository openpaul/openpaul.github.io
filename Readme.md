# About This Repository

This space serves as a collection of analyses I've reproduced from research papers. 
By using the same or similar tools as the original authors, I aim to deepen my understanding of their conclusions and the challenges they faced with the data. 

You can follow along by finding the notebook in the `posts` folder.

## A Note on Datasets

I recognize that I won't always have the time to explore each dataset thoroughly, especially regarding quality and completeness. Therefore, I will assume that the datasets contain what the authors describe and can be used as is. In a real-world scenario, I would delve deeper, examine more parameters, and compare multiple tools.

## Get Involved!
