    "Today I want to implement a very simple bloom filter from scratch. Simply to explore what the challenges are and how far I can get. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters are cool probabilistic data structures that can quickly tell you if you've seen a datapoint before. It has false positives but no false negatives. Wikipedia phrases it as: 'in other words, a query returns either \"possibly in set\" or \"definitely not in set\".', which is a very nice way of phrasing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of machine learning bloom filters could for example be used to deduplicate large datasets. In the case of large protein databases for example, while one will lose some unique protein sequences, it is guaranteed that the final set of protein sequences is unique and the memory demand of a bloom filter is constant.This means that even the largest datasets can be processed with consistent memory usage.\n",

    "As such, bloom filters are a useful tool that should not be missing from any bioinformatician's toolkit.\n"
